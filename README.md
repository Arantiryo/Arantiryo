ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan Tsenilov, a Front-end Software Engineer interested in all things that relate to web development and computer science. I'm currently learning Next.js and and expanding my knowledge about React in general.

As a member of [Cube](https://cube.dev?ref=eco-readme) team I contribute to various open source data visualization tools, such as [react-chartjs-2](https://github.com/reactchartjs/react-chartjs-2) and [react-google-charts](https://github.com/RakanNimer/react-google-charts).

Some of the pet projects I created in my spare time or during various courses organized by [the Rolling Scopes School](https://rs.school/):
- [Louvre website](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/arantiryo-JSFE2021Q3/museum-dom/)
- [English learning app for russian speakers](https://rs-lang-team38.netlify.app/) created in collaboration with [@kondratio](https://github.com/kondratio)
- [Christmas game about decorating a tree](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/arantiryo-JSFE2021Q3/christmas-task)
- [Screensaver app that could be turned into a Chrome extension](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/arantiryo-JSFE2021Q3/momentum/)
